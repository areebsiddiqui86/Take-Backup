Hello people!
I am blazenoob. I am a pretty enthusiastic teen who has just stepped into the coding community, and this is my backup program on Python.
It is pretty basic because I've just started learning how to code on Python. So here goes the summary for this:

--> This backup program can take backup from/of a folder.
--> Currently, The name can only be the date and time of the backup.
--> It is pretty convenient as it shows you if the backup succeeded or failed.

That's pretty much it. Although, I am always open for advices and ideas on how to improve it.
